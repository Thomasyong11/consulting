I want you to create a **production ready React website** for my consulting practice and set it up so I can deploy it on **Vercel with no extra configuration**.

Use **Next.js (latest 14, App Router)** with JavaScript (not TypeScript) and **Tailwind CSS** for styling.

## Brand

Business name: **MEGHA Cloud Consulting** (short form: MEGHA)

Tagline:  
“Practical cloud consulting for small businesses in Ontario.”

Practice description:  
MEGHA is a freelance cloud consulting company that offers small businesses and entrepreneurs in Ontario cost effective and practical cloud solutions. The focus is on helping clients move to the cloud, improve performance, and keep systems reliable, without needing a full time in house IT team. The goal is to make cloud technology manageable, dependable, and accessible so owners can focus on growing their business instead of technical problems.

## Services

Create content and layout for these 3 core services:

1. **Cloud migration and optimization**  
   - Helps small businesses move from older or local systems to cloud platforms like Google Cloud, AWS, or Microsoft Azure.  
   - Includes: assessment of existing workloads, migration roadmap, execution, performance and cost optimization.  
   - Deliverable: a clear migration roadmap and a post migration performance report.

2. **Cloud maintenance and support package**  
   - Short term “mini project” for businesses that cannot afford a full time IT staff.  
   - Includes: regular performance checks, monitoring, troubleshooting, and small fixes to keep things secure and efficient.  
   - Deliverable: a simple summary of maintenance activities and key performance indicators.

3. **Data backup and disaster recovery**  
   - Focuses on setting up automated cloud based backups and recovery plans so important business data is safe.  
   - Includes: backup strategy, configuration, testing of recovery.  
   - Deliverable: a fully configured backup and recovery setup plus a short testing summary.

Write all copy in clear, simple, Canadian English. Think like a friendly, professional first year consultant, not a big corporate agency.

## Brand identity and styling

Use this **colour palette**:

- Main brand colour: soft **green** (for trust, clarity, innovation)  
  Example: `#2ECC71`  
- Secondary colour: **steel grey** (for balance and reliability)  
  Example: `#6C7A89`  
- Tertiary accent: deeper **emerald green** for highlights  
  Example: `#1E8449`  
- Text colour: **charcoal black**  
  Example: `#222222`  
- Background: **white smoke**  
  Example: `#F5F5F5`

Design rules:
- Make it clean, modern, and easy to read.
- Use a simple sans serif font like **Montserrat** or something similar from Google Fonts.
- Use plenty of white space.
- Rounded cards, subtle shadows, and smooth hover effects on buttons and links.
- Fully responsive on phone, tablet, and desktop.

Logo:
- Use a simple text logo in the header: `MEGHA` in uppercase, using the main green and steel grey.  
- You can also add a minimal cloud icon next to the wordmark using Tailwind or an inline SVG.

## Technical requirements

- Use **Next.js App Router** with an `/app` directory.
- Use **Tailwind CSS** configured the usual way for Next.js.
- Do not use a custom server. Keep it compatible with default Vercel deployment.
- Use only libraries that work fine on Vercel with no extra setup.
- Add basic SEO: page titles and meta descriptions for each page.

Package scripts in `package.json` should include:
- `"dev": "next dev"`
- `"build": "next build"`
- `"start": "next start"`

## Pages and structure

Use this structure under `/app`:

- `/app/layout.js`  
  - Global layout with `<html>`, `<body>`, header, footer, and Tailwind setup.
  - Header with logo on the left and navigation links on the right: Home, Services, About, Contact.
  - Sticky or simple top nav that collapses nicely on mobile (hamburger menu).

- `/app/page.js` – **Home page**  
  Sections:
  1. **Hero**  
     - Headline: “Practical cloud consulting for small businesses in Ontario.”  
     - Short subtext about helping small businesses move to and manage the cloud without a full time IT team.  
     - Two buttons:  
       - “View services” (scrolls to the services section on the home page)  
       - “Book a free consult” (links to the Contact page).
  2. **Services preview**  
     - 3 cards, one for each service listed above, with short descriptions and a “Learn more” link to the Services page.
  3. **Why MEGHA section**  
     - A small grid or list of 3 to 4 points such as:  
       - Focus on small businesses  
       - No unnecessary jargon  
       - Flexible, project based support  
       - Reliable and secure setups  
  4. **Call to action**  
     - A simple banner inviting visitors to contact MEGHA for a free 30 minute discovery call.

- `/app/services/page.js` – **Services page**  
  - Repeat the 3 services with more detail:
    - What the service is  
    - Who it is for  
    - What is included  
    - What the client receives at the end  
  - Use nice cards or sections with icons or simple visual elements.
  - Add a small FAQ section at the bottom with 3 to 4 common questions (for example: “Do I need to already use the cloud?”, “Can you work remotely?”, “How long does a migration take?”).
  - End with a “Ready to talk?” area that links to the Contact page.

- `/app/about/page.js` – **About page**  
  - A clear mission statement based on this idea:  
    “MEGHA helps small business owners make sense of the cloud so they can stay focused on running and growing their business. The practice focuses on simple explanations, practical advice, and setups that are safe and reliable.”  
  - A short “About the consultant” section with placeholder text for my name, background in cloud data management, and experience with Azure, AWS, and Microsoft tools.  
  - A small timeline or list of values like “Clarity, Reliability, Security, Respect for your time”.

- `/app/contact/page.js` – **Contact page**  
  - A friendly intro paragraph inviting people to book a free consult or ask a question.
  - A contact form with these fields:
    - Name (text)
    - Email (email)
    - Company name (optional)
    - What are you looking for? (dropdown with the 3 services and “Not sure yet”)
    - Message (textarea)
  - Form must validate basic required fields on the client side.
  - On submit, call an API route and show a success or error message.

- `/app/api/contact/route.js` – **Contact API**  
  - For now, do NOT integrate real email.  
  - Just:
    - Accept a POST request with JSON from the contact form.
    - Validate that name, email, and message exist.
    - Log the payload with `console.log`.
    - Return a JSON response `{ success: true }` or `{ success: false, error: "message" }`.  
  - This should work correctly in development and on Vercel with no environment variables.

## Components

Create a small `/components` folder with:

- `Navbar.js` – used by the layout.
- `Footer.js` – simple footer with:
  - “MEGHA Cloud Consulting”
  - “Based in Ontario, Canada”
  - A placeholder email like `hello@meghacloud.ca` that I can change later.
- `ServiceCard.js` – reusable card component for services.
- `SectionTitle.js` – small helper component for section headings.

Use these components on all relevant pages to keep the design consistent.

## Tailwind styling notes

- Create clear Tailwind utility classes for:
  - Buttons (primary button in main green, secondary button in steel grey).
  - Cards (white background, rounded corners, soft shadow, subtle hover lift).
  - Section containers (max width, center aligned with padding).
- Make sure the site looks good on small screens:
  - Stack sections vertically.
  - Mobile friendly nav menu.

## Final expectations

- When I run `npm install` and `npm run dev` in Replit, the site should run with no errors.
- When I push this project to GitHub and import it into Vercel, it should deploy successfully with the default Vercel settings and show all pages working.
- Please add short comments in the code where I am most likely to edit things later (for example: headings, text content, contact email, and colour variables).
